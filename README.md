## Description
Our application will increase transparency between producers and consumers. It will provide an interface where consumers will be able to communicate with the producers, creating an environment for consumer education.

## User Story
```
As a mindful consumer of locally sourced fresh produce, 

I want to be able to order my produce somewhere that allows me to see where my food is being grown and who is growing it,

So that I can support local growers of produce and increase my education about where my food comes from.

As a farmer of fresh produce,

I want to have a platform to sell my produce that allows users to see where their food is being grown,

So that consumers will be able to learn more about good food production, increasing transparency between producer and consumer.
